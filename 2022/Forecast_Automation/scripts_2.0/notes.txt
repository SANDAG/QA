Group Quarter vs Non-Group Quarter Information: 

Raw MGRA Files: 
- HH (Total number of households): does not include GQ 
- hhp: total household population (exclude gq pop) 

Households file: 
- unittype
    - 0 = Non-GQ Households
    - 1 = GQ Household



Other: 
- It looks like DS41 has extra columns that other DSIDs do not have, DS41 has: MicroAccessTime, remoteAVparking, refueling_stations. DS35 doesn't have these


Current Status:
- Right now the old working code for household number comparison betweeen households and input files is commebted out. Right now I am unsure how to get the number of households for GQ from the input files
