#### **Test 1**

**1a.** Check all unique identifiers in CA_EDD_EMP2018 and CA_EDD_EMP2018HQD datasets.<br/>
**QC Comment:** emp_id is unique in CA_EDD_EMP2018 and sub_emp_id is unique in CA_EDD_EMP2018HQD. 

**1b.** Check for all unique values in address, location.<br/> 
**QC Comment:** There are 25327 duplicate addresses. 8 missing address and 139450 missing "Match_addr". 

**1c.** Check for no NaNs, 0s in dataset.<br/>
**QC Comment:** The majority of variables have NAs  across multiple records, however there are no NA values for emp_id or MGRA13. Blake notes the NAs are acceptable as long as they are not in these variables. There are 2 records for which [ZIP]= 0. These records should be reviewed by the requesting team. Additionally, variables [emp1], [emp2], [emp3], and [payroll] display a number of records equal to 0. These cases were investigated in more detail in Test 2.

```{r test1, include=FALSE}
# Test 1a

length(unique(emp$emp_id))
length(unique(hdqtr$sub_emp_id))

# Test 1b

emp$duplicates<- duplicated(emp$address)

emp_dup<- emp%>%
  filter(duplicates== TRUE)

emp_ndup<- emp%>%
  filter(duplicates== FALSE)

length(unique(emp_ndup$address))== length(unique(emp_ndup$emp_id))

length(unique(emp_dup$emp_id))

# Test 1c
summary(raw_dt)

test1c_na<-as.data.table(raw_dt %>%
  select(everything()) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))))

test1c_zeros<-rbind(table(raw_dt$zip==0),
      table(raw_dt$emp1==0),
      table(raw_dt$emp2==0),
      table(raw_dt$emp3==0),
      table(raw_dt$payroll==0))
test1c_zeros<- as.data.table(cbind(variable=c("zip", "emp1", "emp2", "emp3", "payroll"),
                                   test1c_zeros))
setnames(test1c_zeros, old = c('FALSE','TRUE'), new = c('Not Zero','Zero'))
```


```{r test1ctable, echo=FALSE}


kable(test1c_na, caption="Test 1c: Records with NA")


```

**1d.** Check datatypes of each column makes sense.<br/> 
**QC Comment:** All variable types appear to be appropriate.

```{r test1dtable, echo=FALSE}


kable(test1c_zeros, caption="Test 1d: Records with 0")

```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 2**

**2a.** Check total military employment between the MIL_ACTIVE_DUTY_2018 and EMPLOYMENT2018 tables.<br/>**QC Comment:** Military employment in EMPLOYMENT 2018 table matches with Base Active Duty numbers in MIL_ACTIVE_DUTY_2018 numbers. 

**2b.** Match total military jobs with source data (2018 Demographics Report and US Coast Guard Data)<br/> 
**QC Comment:** Total BaseTotalActiveDuty in MIL_Active_DUTY_2018 dataset matches the source data. 

**2c.** Check all employers with 0 employees have 0 payout (and vice versa).<br/>
**QC Comment:** 1076 fails. Test output file (**EmploymentInventory20200721.xlsx**) containing detailed results can be found in<br/> 
[R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/OutputData](R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/OutputData)

**Test 2d** was dropped after consulting with Data Solutions. 


```{r test2, include=FALSE}
# Test 2a. Sum of military jobs equals military jobs by MGRA

empcore_mil<- subset(empcore, source_table== "MIL_ACTIVE_DUTY_2018")

length(unique(empcore_mil$dba))

sum(empcore_mil$emp_comp, na.rm = TRUE)== sum(mil$BaseActiveDuty)

sum(mil$BaseTotalActiveDuty)

## Test 2c. 

emp2 <- emp %>%
  mutate(pass.or.fail = case_when( emp1==0 & emp2==0& emp3 == 0 & payroll!= 0 ~ "fail", 
                                   emp1==NA & emp2==NA & emp3 == NA & payroll!= NA ~ "fail", 
                                   TRUE ~ "pass"))%>% 
  filter(pass.or.fail== 'fail')

```

<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### **Test 3**

**3a.** Check sum of shares for emp_id =1 for the CA_EDD_EMP2017HQD dataset.<br/>
**QC Comment:** emp_id 155631 (District Office, Avenue of Science) has a total share of 0.14 and emp_id 96146 (Poway Unified School District) has a total share of 0.86. 

**3b.** Check join between CA_EDD_EMP2017 and CA_EDD_EMP2017HQD<br/> 
**QC Comment:** QC team had questions on the following:<br/>
    **3.b.1.** What is the logic of the following?<br/>
               WHEN [emp1] >= [emp2] AND [emp1] >= [emp3] THEN [emp1]<br/> 
               WHEN [emp2] >= [emp1] AND [emp2] >= [emp3] THEN [emp2]<br/> 
               WHEN [emp3] >= [emp1] AND [emp3] >= [emp2] THEN [emp3]<br/> 
    **3.b.2.** Emp_id_comp is the max of emp 1/2/3, should it not be sum? 

**3c.** Check if all emp_ids from CA_EDD_EMP2017HQD are in the CA_EDD_EMP2017<br/>
**QC Comment:** All emp_ids from CA_EDD_EMP2017HQD are in the CA_EDD_EMP2017

```{r test3, include=FALSE}
# Test 3a. All distributed employers in CA_EDD_EMP2018HQD should have an 
#employee total equal to their monthly employment in CA_EDD_EMP2018

emp_hq<- hdqtr%>%
  group_by(emp_id)%>%
  summarise_at(vars(share), funs(sum))

# Test 3b. 

df<- hdqtr%>%
 filter(emp_id %in% emp$emp_id)

length(df$OBJECTID)== length(hdqtr$OBJECTID)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### **Test 4**- This analysis was conducted in PowerBI<br/>

**4a.** Test was dropped after consulting with the Data Solutions team.<br/> 

**4b.** Test was dropped after consulting with the Data Solutions team.<br/> 

**4c.** 'own' should be discretely distributed, no trend<br/> 
**QC Comment:** Nearly all records have assignment of "5"

**4d.** 'meei' should be discretely distributed, no trend<br/>
**QC Comment:** Most records assigned "1", followed by "3", approximately even distribution of "4", "5", and "6". There are no records with "2".

The PowerBI file (**2018 Employment Inventory QA.pbix**) containing the visuals associated with this analysis can be found at<br/>

[R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/OutputData](R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/OutputData)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 5** - This analysis was conducted in ArcGISPro

**5a.** Check if all geocodes are within SD Region area.<br/>
**QC Comment:** All emp_ids are in San Diego County. Check geocoding for two emp_ids which were flagged while creating intersection between SD county boundary and CA_EDD_EMP2018 table in ArcGIS Pro. The emp_ids are mentioned in the test plan. The ArcGISPro PRoject (**Employment Inventory 2018**) is saved at
[R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/WorkSpace/GIS](R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2019/WorkSpace/GIS)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 6** was dropped after consulting with Data Solutions. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 7**

**7a.** Check totals against BLS Quarter 3 2018 (establishments, employees)<br/> 
**QC Comment:** Totals in the SANDAG dataset are slightly lower (~23,000-24,000) for emp1, emp2, and emp3 as compared to BLS. Payroll is approximately $449 million less than BLS. 

**7b.** Check totals against published annual totals from EDD Organization<br/>
**QC Comment:** [R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2018/SourceData](R:/DPOE/Employment/CAEDD/QCEW%20Microdata/RESTRICTED/2018/SourceData)<br/>
Analysis in PowerBI and R revealed discrepancies between txt files and final data from the SQL server for [emp1], [emp2], [emp3], and [payroll] variables. Overall, the final data files show less records than the raw txt files.**This finding requires additional investigation from the requesting team.**

```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 8**
**a.** Match the CA_EDD_EMP2018 dataset with the source raw dataset [SANDAG 2019-1.TXT file]<br/>
**QC Comment:** Text file has 169766 emp_ids (14883 more than the CA_EDD_EMP 2018 file). We cross checked this in both R and PowerBI and got similar result. Please review if this is correct, justified, and needs further investigation. 

```{r test8, include=FALSE}
emp_raw<-readr::read_table("R://DPOE//Employment//CAEDD//QCEW Microdata//RESTRICTED//2019//SourceData//SANDAG 2019-1.TXT",col_names=F)

length(unique(emp_raw$X1))

emp_raw_subset<- emp_raw%>%
  filter(!X1 %in% emp$emp_id)

emp_raw_end_subset<- subset(emp_raw_subset, is.na(X14))


```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### **Test 9**

**9a.** Employment by month per company should be consistent and shouldn't show any major changes, barring a change in operation state of the company

**QC Comment:**
A visual review was done for differences between Month 1 and Month 2, Month 2 and Month 3, and Month 1 and Month 3 (net difference over quarter). Overall, employee change over time was relatively stable for most employers. 

There were several notable exceptions where differences appeared dramatic during a visual review.

**Other Findings**

**a.** Input in variables [end_] and [react] for several records appears invalid. See Test Plan for details. 

**b.** There was a strong positive relationship between the number of [emp1]/[emp2]/[emp3, and the [payroll] for most employers. One employer was an outlier, having a higher payroll and lower employee count than most other employers. Additionally, one employer had a much higher payroll and employee count than most of the other employers in the region, however the payroll-employee relationship for this employer is still aligned with the overall trend.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### **Test 10** was dropped after consulting with Data Solutions. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### **Test 11**

**a.** Every business with employees should have a NAICS code.<br/>
**QC Comment:** 42664 NAICS are NAs, 42664 NAs in emp1/2/3. 1268 are unclassified (999999 NAICS code)

```{r test11, include=FALSE}
emp3 <- emp %>%
  filter(naics!= 'NA')%>%
  mutate(naics_passorfail = case_when( emp1!=0 | emp2!=0 | emp3 != 0 | naics!= 0 ~ "pass", 
                                       emp1== 'NA' & emp2== 'NA' & emp3 == 'NA' & naics == 'NA' ~"pass",
